"""Companion template for tools/build_notebook.py — ARTIFACT-INFERENCE (NOTEBOOK_SPEC 1.1 §3.6, §18).

Generate with ``python tools/build_notebook.py --template tools/notebook_template_artifact_inference.py``. The
notebook carries the same package module and the same pinned snapshot as the task-inference notebook; it consumes
a `model.tabpfn_fit` + `model.ckpt` + `artifact_manifest.json` bundle produced by a *separate* execution (the
task-inference tutorial, or the DIMER worker — same contract) and never creates one.

        "This notebook consumes a DIMER artifact bundle produced **outside this execution** — by the task-inference "
        "tutorial in a separate session, or by the DIMER worker, which writes the same three files: "
        "`artifact_manifest.json`, `model.tabpfn_fit` (fitted estimator state including the in-context training rows) "
        "and `model.ckpt` (foundation weights). It validates the bundle before any model state is deserialised "
        "(manifest schema and task type, member names, sizes, SHA-256 digests, archive safety of the fitted ZIP), "
        "checks the bundled checkpoint against the pinned TabPFN-3 checkpoint carried by this notebook, reconstructs the "
        "estimator through the carried module (`from_artifact`: the fitted archive's recorded `model_path` is rewritten "
        "in a temporary copy to the companion checkpoint; TabPFN's `load_fitted_tabpfn_model` restores the state), "
        "accepts genuinely new unlabelled rows, predicts point estimates, and exports results. **No training, fine-tuning or in-context "
        "refitting occurs, and no artifact is created here.**\n\n"
        "**Trust boundary.** Digest checks establish that the three files are internally consistent, not that the "
        "sender is trustworthy. `model.tabpfn_fit` is a ZIP of JSON parameters plus serialised Python/torch estimator "
        "state and `model.ckpt` is a torch checkpoint; loading them executes trusted model state, and the archive "
        "path-safety checks do not change that. The pinned checkpoint of Section 3 is acquired and digest-verified "
        "independently so the bundled `model.ckpt` can be required to equal it byte for byte. Load only bundles from a "
        "producer you trust, and paste the digests you were given out-of-band into the expected-digest fields. The "

        "## Interpretation and limits\n\n"
        "A successful run proves that an independently supplied bundle is internally consistent with its manifest and "
        "was produced on the pinned TabPFN-3 checkpoint, that the carried module reconstructs the estimator from the "
        "bundle alone without refitting or downloading weights, and that schema-compatible new rows can be scored and "
        "exported. It does **not** authenticate the producer, make untrusted serialised estimator state safe to load, "
        "or establish predictive quality, calibration, fairness or production fitness — the evaluation report is "
        "`not-measurable` by construction. Never bypass a failed digest, schema or archive-safety check; obtain a "
        "correct bundle from a trusted producer.\n\n"
        "Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision's pipeline module, carried in this "
        "notebook, can acquire and digest-verify the pinned checkpoint, validate an external bundle before "
        "deserialisation, reconstruct the serving estimator, validate new rows and emit the shown machine-readable "
        "outputs in the tested runtime — without the repository being reachable. It does **not** establish benchmark "
        "superiority or anything about the quality of the artifact's training rows.\n\n"
        "**Next experiments:** paste the producer's digests into the expected-digest fields and watch a tampered "
        "bundle fail closed; supply rows with a missing feature column and read the structured rejection; compare the "
        "point estimates of the same rows produced by the task-inference notebook's in-memory estimator and by this "
        "reconstruction (they should agree to floating-point precision).\n\n"
