"""Companion template for tools/build_notebook.py /3 — ARTIFACT-INFERENCE (NOTEBOOK_SPEC 2.2 §19, §25.13).

Generate with ``python tools/build_notebook.py --template tools/notebook_template_artifact_inference.py``. The notebook
carries the same package and pinned checkpoint manifest as the E2E notebook and its own stage runner
(``tools/tutorial_stages_artifact_inference.py``). The default path downloads the trusted sample bundle pinned in
``examples/sample_bundle_pin.json`` (NOTEBOOK_SPEC SART6-SART8: release asset ``sample-bundle-v1`` of this repository,
written by ``tools/build_sample_bundle.py`` from a recorded run of the E2E notebook; manifest, fitted archive and eight
unlabelled rows, no checkpoint) and verifies its size and SHA-256 before extraction, then assembles it with the checkpoint
verified in Section 3. A user bundle ZIP (``ARTIFACT_ZIP_PATH`` or an upload) is checked against ``EXPECTED_ZIP_SHA256`` /
``EXPECTED_FITTED_SHA256``. The notebook never creates a bundle.

        "A successful run proves that the bundle passed the member allowlist, the archive-safety rules and the manifest's "
        "schema, size and digest checks, that `model.ckpt` is byte for byte the pinned TabPFN-3 checkpoint, that the fitted "
        "estimator was rebuilt from the bundle alone with its target and feature columns intact, and that schema- and "
        "type-compatible new rows were scored with point predictions — without the repository being "
        "reachable. It does **not** authenticate the producer beyond the channel a trusted digest came through, or establish "
        "predictive quality, uncertainty, robustness, fairness, or production fitness; the evaluation report says "
        "`not-measurable` because no labels exist here, and the exported point values carry no interval, so a decision that "
        "needs a tolerance must bring its own labelled validation data. Never bypass a failed archive, manifest, digest or schema check.\n\n"
        "Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision's package, carried in this notebook, can acquire "
        "and digest-verify the pinned checkpoint, validate and reconstruct an external bundle, validate the supplied inference "
        "table, execute the public prediction path and emit the shown machine-readable outputs in the tested runtime. It does "
        "**not** establish benchmark superiority, deployment calibration, safety for high-consequence decisions, or production "
        "fitness on an unseen domain.\n\n"
        "## Conclusion · [Evaluation practice]\n\n"
        "Write three sentences: what the digest checks and the member allowlist established about the bundle you used; what "
        "the rebuild and the eight predictions show; and what you would need before trusting these values for a "
        "decision.\n\n"
        "<details>\n<summary>Sample conclusion (open after writing yours)</summary>\n\n"
        "The ZIP matched the digest the E2E notebook printed, held exactly the three expected members, and its `model.ckpt` "
        "was the pinned checkpoint verified in Section 3, so every file I loaded is pinned. The estimator was rebuilt from the "
        "fitted archive without refitting, kept its target and feature columns, and scored eight unseen rows with point "
        "predictions that I read against the printed training target range; with no labels the report is correctly `not-measurable`. Before using "
        "these values for a decision I would need a labelled, domain-representative test set to measure the error, and an "
        "uncertainty estimate the pipeline does not provide.\n\n"
        "</details>\n\n"
        "**Next experiments:** paste a digest with one character changed and read the refusal; run the activity with each "
        "`TAMPER` option; score your own rows with an identifier column listed in `ID_COLUMNS`.\n\n"
